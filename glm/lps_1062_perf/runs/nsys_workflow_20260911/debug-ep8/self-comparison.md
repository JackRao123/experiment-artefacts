# Matched Nsight comparison

Left: debug-ep8; right: debug-ep8.

Headline TPS comes from unprofiled controls. Trace categories below are attribution, not headline timing.

| Case | Controls | Mean FB seconds | TPS/GPU | Peak allocated GiB |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| debug-ep8 | 2 | 0.6731 | 24340.7 | 27.21 |
| debug-ep8 | 2 | 0.6731 | 24340.7 | 27.21 |

## Per-rank reconciliation

All deltas are right minus left, milliseconds per profiled FB.

Exclusive categories + mixed-category overlap + GPU idle exactly reconcile to traced step time.

## Interpretation limits

- This reconciliation is an observed wall-time partition, not a causal estimate of removable time.
- Expert GEMM path includes kernel-side helpers; CPU preparation is reflected in scopes and idle, not counted as GEMM GPU work.
- A matched TE/grouped-MM ablation is needed to measure the benefit of the proposed GEMM change.
- FSDP EP8 on eight GPUs has expert-DP size one, whereas EP1 has expert-DP size eight.
- Compare loss/gradients and profiler slowdown before accepting a performance conclusion.
